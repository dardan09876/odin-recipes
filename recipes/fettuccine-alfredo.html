    <h2>
      Fettuccine Alfredo is a creamy Italian pasta dish made with wide
      fettuccine noodles coated in a rich sauce of butter, heavy cream, and
      Parmesan cheese. The sauce is velvety and indulgent, creating a smooth
      texture that perfectly complements the pasta. It’s often garnished with
      black pepper and parsley for a hint of flavor contrast.

    <h2>
      Originally from Rome, Fettuccine Alfredo became popular in the United
      States in the 20th century. While variations with garlic, chicken, or
      shrimp exist, the classic version remains a comforting and flavorful dish
      loved worldwide for its creamy, cheesy richness.
