      Meatballs are small, round portions of seasoned ground meat, typically
      beef, pork, or a combination of both, mixed with breadcrumbs, eggs, and
      spices. They are often shaped by hand and can be pan-fried, baked, or
      simmered in a sauce, such as marinara, for added flavor. Meatballs are
      versatile and can be enjoyed on their own or served with pasta,
      sandwiches, or in soups.

      main course, meatballs are loved for their savory, juicy texture and rich,
      comforting taste.
